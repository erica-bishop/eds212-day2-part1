## Derivative practice
many ways to find derivatives in R: "D" function on experssion or derivative function (need to include 'x" or argument to tell it what derivative is with respect to)
name expression
ex_1: Find derivative of $$f(x) = 5x^2$$

```{r}

ex_1 <- expression(5*x^2)

ex1_derivative <- deriv(ex_1, "x")


```
