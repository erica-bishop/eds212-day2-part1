```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
```

can use functions like glimpse, tail, head, or view to see the data (but be careful with view, returns entire set)
Tidy data structure: one cell, one column for every single variable, (i.e. each penguin has its own row)

##Scatterplot of body mass v flipper length
ggplot needs three things: 1. ggplot(data = ), aes(x,y) + type of chard (i.e. geom)
can add more aesthetics for color, size, etc. within the +plottype(aes()) - if it refers to a variable it goes in aes() if it doesn't refer to variable, goes outside of aes

```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins, 
       aes(x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm)) + geom_point(aes(color = species), size = 1)

```

gg plot is good at recognizing groups within variables and making aesthetic distinctions
#change color of points
